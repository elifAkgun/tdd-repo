There are two kind of test methods. One of them is unit test. 
The other one is integration test.

When we want to test our hole application, we can do integration test.

When we want to test only one method, we can do unit test.

This project is based for tdd methodology. 
So when we need something we will create during that time. 
We will write test after that we will make out implementation.
